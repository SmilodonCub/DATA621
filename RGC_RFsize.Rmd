*"To suppose that the eye with all its inimitable contrivances (...) could have been formed by natural selection, seems, I confess, absurd to the highest degree (...) The difficulty of believing that a perfect and complex eye could be formed by natural selection, though insuperable by our imagination, should not be subversive of the theory"*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our eyes are a remarkable structures and their complexity gave Charles Darwin cause to comment as in the above quote. Although Darwin was marveling at the intricacy of the anterior eye structures (e.g. the lens), in this post we will bring the retina into focus.

## Retinal Circuitry Crash Course

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned in the previous post, the retina is actually an outcropping of the Central Nervous System and as such it is composed of interconnected neurons. Retinal neurons perform complex operations on the visual signals that are transduced by photoreceptors. But why wouldn't the retina simply send the information directly from the photoreceptors and let the brain process the signals? There are many reasons, however, the simplest and most straight forward answer is that there is a wiring bottleneck from eye to brain: There are ~ 6.4 million cone and 110-125 million rod photoreceptors in the human eye.$^1$ If they were to all send axons to project to the brain, this would make the optic nerve prohibitively large and cause all sorts of problems. For example, the point of exit for the optic nerve from the eye creates a space, the optic disc, where there are no photoreceptors and therefore is a blind spot. We typically aren't perceptually unaware of our blind spot. However, I you would like to convince yourself it exists, please check out this demo from [Dr. Michael Bach's Optical Illusions & Visual Phenonmena](https://michaelbach.de/ot/cog-blindSpot/index.html) page.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Evolutionary pressures to simultaneously increase visual acuity (more photoreceptors) while reducing the size of the optic disc (less axons) favor retinal preprocessing of visual information. The retina compresses the information from the photoreceptors by intermixing the signals with both vertical and horizontal connections across the layers of retinal circuitry. Vertical connectivity is made through layers of the retina from the photoreceptors $\rightarrow$ bipolar cells $\rightarrow$ Retinal Ganglion Cells (RGCs). RGCs in the Ganglion cell layer (see figure below) are the output cells of the retina; their axons project through the optic nerve and onwards to the brain. Horizontal connections are established in between layers to interconnect photoreceptors by the Amacrine cells and to interconnect bipolar cells with the Horizontal Cells. As a result, the signals of ~116-132 million photoreceptors are reduced to the output of approximately 1 million RGCs. That reduces the number of axons by two orders of magnitude!

## Parallel Pathways of Retinal Ganglion Cells
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's not just about signal compression, because the retina performs some complex transformations on the photoreceptor signals. For example, there are multiple classes of RGCs that, through distinct anatomy, morphology and connectivity within the retina, effectively carry distinct visual information across parallel pathways from the retina to the brain for further processing$^2$. In the primate retina, the most numerous ganglion cell classes are the Magnocellular (M) and Parvocellular (P) RGCs. There are certainly many other RGC classes$^3$, however, in this post we will focus on M & P RGCs as examples.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many differences between M and P RGCs. Perhaps most the most notable are the differences in physiological responses between the two cells classes, where a physiological response refers to the neurons' changes in electrical excitability due to an environmental stimulus. Parvocellular RGCs are commonly observed to have longer, or sustained responses that are preferential to red-green chromatic stimuli whereas Magnocellular RGCs typically have a shorter or 'transient' response that is preferential of achromatic (light-dark) luminance stimuli.$^{4,5}$ This difference in response arises due to differences in patterns of connectivity between the two RCS classes. One way that this difference manifests is a difference in receptive field size. The receptive field of a RGC refers to the region of visual space where changes in visual stimuli will elicit a change, or physiological response from the cell.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the following code, we will explore a data set adapted from Cronin & Kaplan (1994) that demonstrates the differences in receptive field sizes for M and P RGCs.$^7$ RGC receptive fields are described as having a center-surround structure: vertical connections from the bipolar layer form the center input which has an antagonistic relationship to the presumably horizontal connections that make up the surround. Here, Cronin and Kaplan measured the receptive field center sizes for M and P RGCs in the primate retina: 


```{r message = F}
#load the data into the R environment
url <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SmilodonCub/DATA621/master/macaqueRGCs.csv'
Macaque_RGCs <- read_csv( url )
glimpse( Macaque_RGCs )
```
Let's visualize the receptive field center sizes for M and P RGCs as a function of Eccentricity.  
**Eccentricity** refers to how far from the center of vision the receptive field is located and is measure in [degrees of visual angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_angle).
```{r message=F}
#visualize with ggplot
ggplot( data = Macaque_RGCs, aes( x = Eccentricity, y = Diameter, col = Class) ) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5, size = 3) +
  geom_smooth( method = 'lm' ) +
  theme_classic() +
  ggtitle('Receptive Field Center Size', subtitle = 'M & P center sizes as a function of retinal eccentricity') +
  ylab( 'Center Radius (deg)' ) +
  xlab( 'Eccentricity (deg)' )
```
The figure above plots receptive field center radius for M and P RGCs. We can see a clear difference between the two distributions.  
Here we visualize box plots of the Radius and Eccentricity distributions for both cells classes

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot( data = Macaque_RGCs, aes( x = Class, y = Diameter ) ) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic() +
  ggtitle( 'Radius' ) +
  ylab( 'Radius (deg)' )

p2 <- ggplot( data = Macaque_RGCs, aes( x = Class, y = Eccentricity ) ) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_classic() +
  ggtitle( 'Eccentricity' ) +
  ylab( 'Eccentricity (deg)' )

grid.arrange( p1, p2, ncol = 2 )
```
From the box plots above we see that for

Next we will use a logistic regression to further describe the distinctions between the two cell classes.

logistic regression of M & P

```{r}
Macaque_RGCs <- Macaque_RGCs %>%
  mutate( Mcells = Class == 'M' )
RGC_logit <- glm( data = Macaque_RGCs, Mcells ~ Diameter + Eccentricity, family = binomial( link = 'logit' ) )
summary( RGC_logit )
```
```{r}
anova( RGC_logit, test = 'Chisq' )
```
